##Hamilton-API-Practice

As the CTO of the Margaret Hamilton Interplanetary Academy of Code, you are tasked with building a RESTful API for the Academy's web app. 

This web app should allow users to register new Instructors and Campuses, as well as assign specific instructors to a specific campus. Instructors, campuses and assignments should all be deletable too.

Things to consider:
	
	1. What models will we need? How should they be associated? (`db/index.js`)

	2. What model methods will we need?

	3. What CRUD routes should we create for our various models? (`routes` folder)

Your API should pass all the test specs within the `test` folder. Note that a swig frontend has already been created, study the various html files and let that help you make engineering decisions for your API.
